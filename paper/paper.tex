\section*{Outline of main argument}


\begin{itemize}
\item Evolutionary game theory has become an established philosophical tool for probing into
  conceptual issues whose complexity requires mathematical modeling. Most applications of EGT
  look at evolutionary selection of behavior in a single game. This game is then considered
  fixed, closed and immutable.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item there are some notable exceptions where the game is open ended, e.g., by the invention
    of actions \citep{WordenLevin2007:Evolutionary-es, McKenzie-AlexanderSkymrs2012:Inventing-New-S}
  \end{itemize}

\item We present an approach to studying evolutionary selection of \emph{choice principles},
  i.e., ways of choosing consistently across several games. In other words, we would like to
  look at the problem of ``rational choice'' from an evolutionary point of view: what choice
  principles would be promoted, which demoted in evolutionary competition amongst each other?

\item This depends on the environment; it depends on what choice situations occur how
  frequently. Maybe some choice principle is better in some situations, while another one is
  better in others. To capture the relevant statistics of the environment, we therefore look at
  the evolutionary competition of choice principles in a ``meta-game'' that consists of the
  average expected payoffs of choice principles when playing arbitrary games (from a given
  class). In this sense, a meta-game captures (the modeller's) assumptions about the relevant
  statistic of the environment in which evolutionary forces operate.

\item To demonstrate how this approach can be theoretically rewarding, we show that, under
  reasonable additional assumptions, maximization of expected utility is not the only choice
  principle supported by evolutionary selection. In particular, we show that evolutionary
  selection can support non-veridical representations of payoffs in terms of regret. 

\item We argue that this ``meta-evolutionary'' approach could eventually help explain attested
  deviations of human decision making from the classical ideal: choice behavior evolved to be
  an ``ecologically rational'', near-optimal adaptation to the environment
  \citep{Anderson1990:The-Adaptive-Ch,Anderson1991:Is-human-cognit,GigerenzerGoldstein1996:Reasoning-the-F,ChaterOaksford2000:The-Rational-An}. This
  is inline with recent aspirations to provide an evolutionary rationale for decision making
  processes
  \citep[e.g.][]{HammersteinStevens2012:Six-Reasons-for,FawcettHamblin2013:Exposing-the-be}. Here,
  we seek to contribute to the formal machinery, an extension of evolutionary game theory, that
  allows to capture statistical properties of the environment
  \citep[cf.][]{McNamara2013:Towards-a-Riche}.

\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction / Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item evolutionary game theory about one game usually
\item here class of games
\item therefore partial solution to the ``closed game'' problem
\item still not infinite, open ended strategy space
\item focus on one example for this new method: competition between:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item probabilistic vs.~non-probabilistic uncertainty
  \item veridical vs.~regret-based preferences
  \end{itemize}
\item contributes to: (i) methodological reflection on evolutionary game theory, (ii) ecological
  rationality of choice behavior, (iii) evolution of preferences literature
\end{itemize}

\section{Faces of rationality}


VERSION 1

A central pivot in economics and decision theory is the definition of rationality as maximization of subjective preferences. The subjectivity of preferences plays a very important role. From an agent's standpoint, the amount of, say, money achieved does not necessarily coincide with the amount of subjective utility attained. The first to notice this difference between objective utility (goods, money, etc.) and subjective utility (preferences) was D. Bernoulli in the famous St. Petersburg paradox. Moreover, Bernoulli introduced the idea that subjective utility can be represented by an increasing concave function of objective utility. This can be considered the birth of modern decision theory.
Another important step was developed by Kahnemann and Tversky who introduced prospect theory in their famous paper from 1979. By means of experimental results they noticed that the decision maker apparently acts as a risk averse agent with respect to gains and as a risk loving agent with respect to losses. Consequently, they conjectured that the subjective utility is better representable by an S-shaped utility function, concave in the positive domain of gains and convex in the negative domain of losses.
More recently, other possible definitions of the subjective utility function have been proposed and justified from a game theoretical point of view (e.g. Fehr and Schmidt, Charness and Rabin, etc.). The central goal of these studies is to explain/describe the behavior in social dilemmas (e.g., Prisoner's dilemma, public goods game, etc.). By means of different subjective utility functions, it is then possible to describe/match the behavior observed in experiments and to explain it as rational (in the sense of maximizing the subjective utility). \\
With this approach it seems that every behavior, no matter how far from the maximization of objective utility, can be deemed as rational if we can only find a subjective utility that justifies that behavior as maximizing the subjective utility. Quoting Hegel, (almost) everything real is rational. The problem with this approach is that it seems that everything that is observed can be considered rational, given the adequate subjective utility. The notion of rationality almost collapses onto the observed behavior.

On the other side, other economists (Alchian, Friedman) seem to link the notion of rationality more tightly to the maximization of objective utility. In their classic works they argue that profit maximization is a reasonable assumption for characterizing outcomes in a competitive market because only firms behaving in a manner that is consistent with profit maximization will survive in the long run. If the previous accounts of rationality looked more descriptive, this definitely tastes more normative. In this sense, the normative notion of rationality is tightly linked to (and almost coincide with) the maximization of objective utility, which is supposed to drive the evolutionary process. It follows then that being normative in this sense seems to entail an identification of rationality with maximization of objective utility.

It seems that we are stuck between two extrema. On the one hand, if we want to have a descriptive notion of rationality, then it seems we can (almost) always define an appropriate subjective utility whose maximization matches the observed behavior. On the other hand, if we want to have a normative approach to rationality, then it seems we have to appeal to evolutionary arguments implying the understanding of rationality as maximization of objective utility.

The meta-game perspective that we introduce here can shed more light on this duality, and opens some space in between the two extrema. By keeping the evolutionary approach we want to retain a normative perspective on rationality, but our results show that (under certain conditions) evolution does not necessarily lead to identifying rationality with maximization of objective utility. More precisely, from the meta-game perspective many possible subjective transformations of the objective utility are eliminated by evolution, but we find some evolutionarily stable subjective utility maximizers whose utility does not coincide with the objective evolutionary utility. This result leaves some room in between the two extrema: we can understand rationality in a normative way, given by evolution, without having to discard all the possible subjective utility representations as irrational.

In particular, in the following we mainly deal with two types of agents: players whose utility function coincides with the objective utility, and players whose subjective utility is defined in terms of regret. The justification for this choice is both historical and behavioral. Among the possible competitors of utility maximization, regret has always been in a prominent position, both from a descriptive and normative viewpoint. Indeed, Bell82 writes 
\begin{quote}
By explicitly incorporating regret, expected utility theory not only becomes a better descriptive predictor but also may become a more convincing guide for prescribing behavior to decision makers.
\end{quote}

\citet{LoomesSugden1982:Regret-Theory:-} show that a regret-based theory of choice can match and explain the main experimental results of prospect theory, and claim that
\begin{quote}

[...] we shall challenge the idea that the conventional axioms constitute the only acceptable basis for rational choice under uncertainty. We shall argue that it is no less rational to act in accordance with regret theory, and that conventional expected utility theory therefore represents an unnecessarily restrictive notion of rationality. \cite{loosug82}

VERSION 2

The importance of aiming at a richer evolutionary game theory has been recently emphasized by many works in theoretical biology and behavioral ecology [Fawcett\&al., McNamara, etc.]. The biological argument to embrace this goal is related to the criticisms towards the so-called behavioral gambit [Fawcett\&al.]. The behavioral gambit denotes the standard approach in evolutionary game theory that puts the focus of attention on the expressed behavior, and neglects the underlying mechanisms that generate that behavior. From this point of view, the benefit and the reliability coming from the use of evolutionary game theory for biological purposes is also under attack. There are good reasons to claim that focusing on the general psychological mechanisms instead of on behavior itself as the phenotype under evolutionary selection can be more faithful and insightful for natural biology and ecology [Fawcett\&al.].
Standard evolutionary game theory normally models the agents as playing a single fixed game, and as genetically predetermined to play fixed strategies, that consequently are the only target of natural selection in those frameworks. Standard models of evolutionary game theory cannot take charge of this shift of perspective until they will keep modelling a single game at a time, and until they will keep focusing on actions considered genetically encoded and fixed. ''Instead we should expect animals to have evolved a set of psychological mechanisms which enable them to perform well on average across a range of different circumstances''[Fawcett\&al.].

Attempts to overcome the behavioral gambit have recently been developed in economic literature too. In the last twenty years economists have been using evolutionary game-theoretical models to study evolution of preferences [cite], instead of evolution of behavior only. This approach is called indirect evolutionary approach, because players' behavior and actions stem from their subjective preferences, and it is aimed at investigating what subjective preferences are evolutionarily better off and robust with respect to natural selection. This shift from a direct evolutionary approach about observed actions and behavior to an indirect evolutionary approach takes only partly into account the behavioral gambit criticized by biologists and ecologists. The reason is that the models of evolution of preferences usually consider only one game at a time. This means that there is a single type of interaction that is supposed to drive the whole evolution of preferences: preferences are selected on the basis of one possible interaction only. Clearly, this approach does not take into consideration the variety of possible circumstances that animals are supposed to face during their lifetime. 

The meta-game model we propose pays heed to both components of the behavioral gambit. We retain the indirect evolutionary approach, but our agents in the population play over a class of possible games $\mathcal{G}$. In this way we explicitly model a range of different circumstances, as wished by theoretical biologists.  Consequently, each agent in the population does not represent either a simple behavior or a subjective preference, but a more general player type that associates a subjective preference for each game in the class $\mathcal{G}$. The player type is supposed to encode the general psychological mechanisms that generate the behavior for any possible interaction in $\mathcal{G}$. These general psychological mechanisms then become the target of evolution, and they are selected based on the average fitness over a class of different interactions. 

In particular, in the following we mainly deal with two types of agents: players whose subjective preference coincides with the evolutionary fitness, and players whose subjective preference is defined in terms of regret. It turns out that psychological mechanisms and subjective conceptualizations based on regret can outperform more veridical conceptualizations coinciding with the evolutionary fitness.
This is just an example of the kind of insights and results that we can gain by adopting a meta-game perspective and by shifting the focus of our attention to psychological mechanisms and subjective conceptualizations as the phenotype under selection.


-maybe to add: difference with learning. Fawcett\&al. talk more about differences in learning, whereas we model differences in subjective conceptualizations.

\section{Evolution \& the environment}

here we spell out our model

\subsection{Choice principles}

\begin{itemize}
\item study evolutionary competition between \emph{choice principles} 
\item for now a choice principle is a pair (epistemic type, preference type)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item two epistemic types:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item probabilistic beliefs (assumed to be flat)
    \item non-probabilistic beliefs
    \end{enumerate}
  \item two preferences types (references to ``evolution of preference'' literature):
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item veridical payoff representations
    \item regret-based payoffs
    \end{enumerate}
  \item many other types are conceivable; more in discussion section
    \begin{itemize}
    \item we want to keep it simple
    \item assume that agents are relatively simple as well
    \item no learning from past encounters \& no reasoning about the opponent: agents simply do
      not know that there is another player (no strategic thinking possible; in line with idea
      of evolutionary game theory where agents are ``stupid'' and ``myopic'') \\
      \textcolor{blue}{this is then the added assumption that may be crude and generally
        implausible but allows us to deflect the economists' critique}
    \end{itemize}
  \item choice principles yield action choices for each game
    \begin{itemize}
    \item show how
    \end{itemize}
  \item RESULT: types (prob., veridical) and (prob., regret) are choice-equivalent (also
    mentioned by \citet{HalpernPass2012:Iterated-Regret})
  \item RESULT: in $2 \times 2$ cases, (prob., veridical), (prob., regret) and (non-prob.,
    regret) are choice-equivalent (but not for $n \times n$ in general)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item still we treat them as separate types because they behave differently under
      component-wise mutation (see below)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The environment: meta-games}

\begin{itemize}
\item imagine huge, virtually infinite population of agents, each carrying a choice principle
\item agents play a randomly sampled game against a randomly sampled opponent
\item fitness is based on the average payoff of choice principle A against choice principle B,
  taken over arbitrary games $g$ and weighted their occurrence probability $P(g)$:
  $\int_g P(g) \times U_g(\text{CP-A}, \text{CP-B}) \text{d}g$
\item the occurrence probability of games $g$ is the ``environment'' and, possibly, impossible to
  derive theoretically, or to measure empirically
\item here, use a relatively neutral approach instead that is practicable:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item games are individuated by their payoff matrices (no framing effects or similar)
  \item each entry in a payoff matrix is an i.~i.~d.~random variable
    \begin{itemize}
    \item approach still incorporates a bias (e.g., against strategic form representations of
      sequential games)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item example: average payoffs from numerical simulation of ($2 \times 2$ symmetric games)
\item example: average payoffs from numerical simulation of ($n \times n$ symmetric games, with
  $n$ uniformly random (up to some upper-bound))
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

\textcolor{gray}{keep this clean and concise, formal details (proofs) in appendix}

\subsubsection{$2 \times 2$ symmetric games}

\textcolor{gray}{we isolate this case because it is most basic, and we can offer analytical
  proofs as well}

\begin{itemize}
\item given previous results, there are really only two kinds of types to look at:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item (prob., veridical), (prob., regret) and (non-prob., regret) \\ 
    \textcolor{gray}{[all choice-equivalent in this case]}
  \item (non-prob., veridical)
  \end{enumerate}
\item RESULT: the former class ``dominates'' the latter (our main result, Proposition 1 from
  TARK paper)
\item this means that evolutionary dynamics would weed out (non-prob., regret); every
  population composition between the remaining three is neutrally stable; all interior
  trajectories (of the replicator dynamic) converge to these
\item further results (from TARK):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item component-wise mutation: abundance of regret types
    \begin{itemize}
    \item different evolutionary paths despite the same behavior (contra the ``behavioral
      gambit'' \citep{FawcettHamblin2013:Exposing-the-be})
    \end{itemize}
  \item exogenously given correlated epistemic types: regret types dominate
  \item exogenously given uncorrelated epistemic types: regret types dominate
  \end{itemize}
\todo[inline]{work out these additional results more carefully; present graphs if possible}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{$n \times n$ symmetric games}

\todo[inline]{work out these additional results more carefully; present graphs if possible}

\item what could be done next
