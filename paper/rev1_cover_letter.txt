## Reviewer 2

Reviewer 2 raises three critical issues.

1. Exposition.

We have rewritten the whole first part of the paper to ease the readers’ understanding of the crucial aspects of the model. Towards this end, we have tried to reduce terminology and formal notation and instead to present notions in a more intuitive and more linearly structured fashion.

2. “thin result”

The reviewer considers our contribution to the evolution of preference as “thin.” The relevant passage reads as follows in the review:

“After describing the approach, the author uses the framework to study the evolution of preferences. His work shows that in some cases regret minimizing preferences are evolutionarily optimal. I suppose a key message here is that sometimes evolution will favor preferences that differ from those leading to objective fitness maximization, as these regret minimizing preferences will yield choices that differ from material payoff maximization. (This is a point made also by Rayo and Becker 2007, /Journal of Political Economy/). Here, I think the contribution of the paper rather is thin. The author compares a very restricted class of preferences to the regret minimizing (RM) ones. Among this very restricted class, yes, RM is optimal in some cases, but the author’s result is driven by his restrictions on the class of preferences considered.”

We have tried to work out better in the paper why we believe that the overall contribution of the paper is interesting, relevant and meaty enough. First of all, we have tried to make clearer that our contribution is actually two-fold: to introduce our version of a fairly general meta-game approach, and to give one exemplary application of it that does have philosophically interesting spin-off. The reviewer’s comment seems to be targeted at the latter part only and may, in part, be based on a misunderstanding. To make our point clearer the revised version of the paper stresses that we do not want to argue that regret-based preferences rule supreme. Our key result is, like the reviewer states, that regret can outcompete representations based on the true material payoff. While Rayo & Becker (2007) arrive at a similar-sounding conclusion, their result is unrelated to regret, (which we think is interesting given its intuitive appeal and its long tradition in the literature on rational choice). Moreover, Rayo & Becker’s work is based on rather specific assumptions about particular cognitive constraints. Our results, in contrast, hinge on the possibility of unmeasurable uncertainty, in which case agents may have imprecise beliefs. For these reasons, we believe that the results from the regret-vs-objective application are substantial and theoretically interesting and we hope that the shifts and additions of emphasis in the current version make this come to the foreground. A brief comparison with the work by Rayo & Becker (2007), as well as with other related results in the literature, is now also directly addressed in the paper, in footnote 1. 

3. “justify the restrictions imposed on representations of beliefs”

The reviewer points out correctly that the paper has so far only looked at “maximally uncertain” beliefs, i.e., we only looked at uniform distributions for precise beliefs and full-range imprecise beliefs. Here is what the reviewer wrote in full:

“In particular, the author considers only representations with fixed beliefs, that is, representations that map every game to a fixed subjective probability distribution over the opponent’s choices (the precise beliefs case in the author’s terms), or a fixed set of such subjective beliefs (the imprecise beliefs case, in the author’s terms). Among this restricted set of representations the regret minimization representation dominates when beliefs are imprecise. However, imprecise beliefs here are maximally imprecise---the set of beliefs entertained by the decision maker contains all possible probability distributions over the opponent’s choices. It would be interesting if the author could relate the degree of imprecision to the advantages of regret minimizing preferences. For example, suppose DMs were minimally rational in the sense that they avoided dominated actions when there were such actions available. Would including this information in the representation affect the author’s result? I think so. In fact, consider a Nash Equilibrium representation as follows. The representation has 𝜃(𝑔) = 𝑔 for every game in 𝐺, that is, the payoff representation reflects the true objective payoffs of the game. Then, for each 𝑔, 𝑒(𝑔) assigns probability one to a strategy of the opponent that is part of a Nash equilibrium of the game. A Nash equilibrium representation seems to dominate any representation considered by the author (in particular, RM preferences), against a player with the same Nash representation (when the games considered are symmetric).”

“I think the author should argue to justify the restrictions imposed on representations in the analysis. For example, are there cognitive constraints on the DM such that he/she can only entertain one fixed set of beliefs about his/her opponent in any possible game?”


We are in full agreement with the reviewer that this is an obvious lacuna in the first version of the paper. We had been aware of that and regret deeply that we have not managed to address this worry more clearly. The revised version of the paper follows the reviewer’s plea to justify the focus on maximally uncertain beliefs at several places, most notably in and around footnote 4. We suggest that unawareness or lack of common knowledge of the game could be a source of unmeasurable uncertainty, just like, in an evolutionary context, lack of knowledge about the population composition could be another one (see the quote of Battigalli et al. (2015) in the same section). As we stress in the paper, it seems natural in an evolutionary context to start the inquiry with minimal assumptions about agents’ sophistication — a sort of methodological gradual minimalism. 

But of course, it is important to ask what will happen when agents have more sophisticated beliefs, e.g., like the Nash equilibrium representations mentioned by the reviewer. The current version of the paper has two particular additions that directly address the concern raised by the reviewer. Firstly, we have included a further formal result (Proposition 2) that extends our previous result (Proposition 1) to cases of non-maximally imprecise beliefs. Secondly, we have added the short subsection 6.4 in the part on “extensions” that directly addresses the relevance of our results for models of more sophisticated belief formation. The main point to notice is that, given a fixed precise belief, regret-based and objective preferences will give rise to the exact same action choices, no matter whether the precise belief is maximally uncertain (a uniform distribution) or the outcome of sophisticated learning or strategic reasoning. As a result, regret-based preference representations cannot be outclassed by objective representations in general. Moreover, regret can be positively selected for as long as there is a chance of more sophisticated agents still having imprecise beliefs.

## Reviewer 3

The reviewer kindly provided very useful pointers to related literature. We have carefully studied or reread the mentioned papers and have included all references in the paper. Footnote 1 picks out the most striking resemblances and differences between our work and the previous literature. Footnote 8 also connects our approach with other works mentioned by the reviewer. We have chosen not to summarize all of the mentioned papers in detail in the paper because of space constraints, since we felt it was more important to clearly and extensively cover our own positive contribution.
