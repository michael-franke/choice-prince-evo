to be included:

NON-ITERATION

* analytical proofs
  - symmetric 2x2: RM best security strategy
  - RM + beliefs = Max-EU

* simulation results for asymmetric games (arbitrary size):
  - ...< EU-arbitrary < RM < EU-flat

ITERATION

* iterative choice principles: compare "winners of previous
  comparison"

* investigate evolutionary dynamics with parameterized costs

---

to do:

* fix procedure for generating "meta-games" & communicate this with
  Paolo, so he uses right method for analysis

* characterize cost parameters (thresholds) in more general terms

*
